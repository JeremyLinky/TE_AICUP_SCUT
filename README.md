# An algorithm
This project is about an algorithmic competition called *TE cup*. 
It's a preliminary version used to achieve the requirements  of the competition. 
The purpose is to classify the Ok and NOK samples using data sampled by machine.
We mainly use a simple but effective neural network by pytorch to achieve this.
Though several problems remained, we will modify in the future.

## Train the sensor data
  -  python train.py
## Evaluate the model
  - python test.py 
## Inference of an input
  - python inference.py
